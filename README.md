US-Tax-Code
===========

A Ruby API based on the US Tax Code with testing application

The idea is to convert the US Tax Code into a usable Ruby API.  Then create a testing program that accepts US census and tax information as input and runs it through the API to produce real budget and taxpayer burden information.  The community can then experiment with modifications to the tax code to produce a better system


Guidelines for development/modifications
- Pair any code with comments that source the text of the tax code being implemented.  When modifying code, also modify the text to reflect the changes.  This will allow a coherent text document to be produced from final results.
